> * Project Title: Analysing resilience of interdependent power grids

## General Introduction
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)

With the trend of libralization of energy market, the integration of energy systems become a more and more important topic. Understanding the resilience of interdependent power grids is thus needed for designing the construction. 

We are going to generate and analynise the cascading failure and its solution for abstract interdependent networks, and use the empirical data of historical blackout for implementing our methods. We would also use the SFINA package as reference to simulate the result for real power grids.

(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

We refer our project to a network-based model, which basically abstract the power grid as nodes and lines, and we generate different methods to shut down nodes or lines to represent the blackout and study the cascading failure afterwards.
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

1. How to understand the robustness of our current infrastructure network.
2. What causes the cascading failure of power grids. 
3. How can we improve the stabilitity and functionality of power grids under partial failure. 


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
